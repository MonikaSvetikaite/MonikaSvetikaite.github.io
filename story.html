			<h2> Storyline </h2>
			
			<p id="continue"> <a href ="room1.html"> Continue</a></p>
			
			<p id="text"> On a calm Friday afternoon, you walk through the forest 
			enjoying the calm surroundings. The sun is slowly setting, the mellow
			sunlight peeking through the leaves that are lightly moving with the 
			wind. As you head home there is a change in the atmosphere an unsettling
			feeling like there is someone watching, the feeling only intensifies. 
			Your heart starts racing, you pick up the pace and look back, the forest 
			is starting to disappear into the darkness as the sun is now below the tree 
			line and the wind is picking up.  </p>
			
			<p id="text1"> You hear a twig snap, without looking back you start 
			running but only after a few minutes you stop for a break. Leaning 
			against a tree to calm the breathing, you look around and realize that
			you are lost, panic starts to kick in and then you spot a figure coming 
			towards you. They seem to have something in their hand, you do not examine 
			the person and turn to run, making their job easy by running into a tree 
			and knocking yourself out.</p>
